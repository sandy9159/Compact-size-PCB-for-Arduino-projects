This is multipurpose PCB specially design for arduino projects so that we can connect multiple components at once with arduino
Those who ever worked with arduino they know the pain of connecting multiple components to the arduino for there projects. so here is the answer for you all.

Not only 2 or 3 you can connect 11 components at same time & on board 5V & 9V regulator,

cross polarity protection, power indication LED,

motor power selection provision (5V or 9V or 12V) manual provision for stepper motor microstepping setting.

Wide range of input supply (9V to 24V). This is my multipurpose PCB works with Arduino Nano, I have designed it in a way that you can run 2 Stepper motors, 2 DC motors, 2 Servo motors at same time and this is not it you can even connect BT module, rotary encoder, I2C device, potentiometer at same time.

This PCB is very much helpful in building any project and no need to worry about messy wire connections.

I design this PCB in Easyeda and order it from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT) they offer very affordable rate for quality PCB.

**Step 1: Overview of PCB**

He we first see the overview of PCB means what is this PCB capable of and which components you can connect to the PCB.

**List of the Components you can connect to the PCB**
